# 42-Philosophers

## Introduction
The mandatory part of this project asks us to solve the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem'>dining philosophers problem</a> and 
implement a mutithreading solution. In order to better understand the solution that we are going to implement in this project I suggest you to read something about what
a thread is and how multithreading works, I'll leave a couple of wikipedia references to start learning about these topics:
<ul>
<li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)'>Thread</a></li>
<li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)'>Multi Threading</a></li>
</ul>

```sh
